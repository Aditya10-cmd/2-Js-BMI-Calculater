BMI Calculator
This is a basic JavaScript project that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
After calculating the BMI, it displays whether the user is Underweight, Normal weight, or Overweight according to standard BMI ranges.
The project uses simple event handling, input validation, and dynamic DOM updates to show the result.
